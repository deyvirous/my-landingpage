      <p>An essay on Career Goals</p>

    <h2>Hot Start?</h2>
    <p>
      When I started college, it was a fresh new start: new people, a new environment, a new place, and new rules. I had made up my mind to pursue Computer Science before I started senior high school. Now I am at the stage where I do not even know I belong in this program.
    </p>

    <h2>Curiousty and Regrets</h2>
    <p>
      I thought this program was going to be my dream, what I have striven for in 2 years to taking. Now I feel so out of place, constantly being left behind in discussions. In 5 years, I do not have a specific career path; I am still trying to discover my identity in Technology. I have resonated with the thought of not becoming a professional in any sport I have tried so hard to have a place in, and it sucks. However, right now, I guess I am leaning towards something not heavy coding, as I am not confident in my skills in coding, so a developer is probably out of the picture. In my 2 years in the University, I really liked the subject Information Management, because it is not heavy into coding, it's about managing and editing databases where you store a lot of information. A career path that also intrigues me is cybersecurity, but we haven’t learn much stuff about it yet.

    <h2>Searching</h2>
    <p>
      As of right now, I ask myself if I am on the right path? taking every moment one step at a time. I do not have a plan for myself 5 years from now, career wise. I just enjoy the process of preparing myself professionally and living in the moment.
