      <h1>Chasing Health</h1>
      <p>An essay on Health and Lifestyle</p>
    </header>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      To everyone, health is wealth; being healthy is a pretty great privilege to have. When I was a kid, I was very afraid of dying from health issues; everyone around me died from sickness. I lost my lola to breast cancer, my lolo to cardiac arrest, and my other lolo to heart failure. It seems like sickness runs in the family, as my parents are also experiencing it, with my dad having high blood pressure.

    <h2>Main Content</h2>
    <p>
      I thought about being active in a lot of physical stuff, because maybe that was the solution to avoiding these illnesses. I got into football when I was in junior high school and played varsity, played basketball for perpetual help in senior high school, and I also got into weightlifting and have been doing it for 3 years now. But as I grew older, this lifestyle of being healthy shaped me into who I am today. Because of these activities, I met a lot of special people and learned so much. Being healthy really isn't the priority anymore; I just enjoy the ride.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
     As of right now, I really enjoy this profound lifestyle, eating healthy and reducing junk food, and exercising regularly every week. It makes my life fulfilling, it makes me feel complete. Sometimes I even use exercising as an escape when I'm feeling down, it improves my mental health because exercising makes me think clearly. I used to chase health because of fear. But as of this moment, I chase health because it embodies what I am today.
