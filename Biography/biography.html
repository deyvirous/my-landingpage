  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
   If I would describe my childhood, it would be fun and productive. My parents used to work at the capitol in my province of Isabela and that made us move a lot before I even started nursery. My late grandmother and grandfather used to always fetch me at the house when my parents go to work; it was a 30-minute car ride between us. My favorite memory with them is when they would bring me to Jollibee and eat at the car; we used to always listen to Ilocano songs because my grandpa had loads of mixtapes back then. My grandma was a teacher, she always used to teach me many heavy words and basic math, when I was three learned how to play chess, scrabble, and word factory as I would always play with them, and my grandpa taught me how to ride a bike at the same age. After my parents moved for the last time we lived with our grandparents. In pre-school, I always competed in extracurricular activities such as coloring, drawing, and pageants, I would always cry if I did not win or did not have a placing because I was such as competitive child. We would go on a lot on vacations especially in Ilocos and Quezon City, because we had houses there. We would go whenever it is the holidays or if a family member came home from the U.S. In elementary, I went to the school my grandma used to work at, I would get special treatment because they all were friends and respected her. My favorite memory when going on vacation is when we go to Ilocos, because we used to eat a lot of seafood in the beach during those visits. In addition, when we do visita iglesia in places we visit like in Manila. To sum it all up, I really enjoyed my childhood, especially when I was with my grandparents because they would spoil me a lot.

    Before the creation of AI also known as Artificial Intelligence, life was more simple. Artificial Intelligence started to gain traction during the end of the Coronavirus epidemic. When I first discovered AI, I used it as a learning tool for topics I did not understand much, and classes I had missed due to being a student-athlete at the time. As a slow learner, AI helped me catch up with my peers. Then as time went by, I started getting lazy with my studies as I let Artificial Intelligence answer my homework for me rather than just guiding me because it made everything easier. It made a difference in my daily life as I finished academic tasks earlier, making my time more manageable as a student-athlete.

    The downside to this is I became too dependent on AI and became lazy with doing my studies without the help of Artificial Intelligence. This is also apparent for the rest of the world as people became more dependent on AI; professions changed forever. An example of this is the IT Industry. As AI became bigger, the industry became more in demand and changed. People were not hired simply because of talent in coding—they needed a certain level of knowledge about AI, because Artificial Intelligence can create code by simply instructing it to do so. This happens in various industries too such as the Art Industry. AI ruined the industry because of AI-generated media; people began to make videos, art, and music with just AI.

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    To sum it all up, Artificial Intelligence makes a big difference because it is a great tool that makes tasks easier. We can all benefit from using Artificial Intelligence, but if you use it too much and for the wrong reasons, people can become dependent on it and it removes the purpose of learning and doing things on your own. As Artificial Intelligence continues to grow and become popular, people should be wary of the use of these tools in order for us to have purpose.
