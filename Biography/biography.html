  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
   If I would describe my childhood, it would be fun and productive. My parents used to work at the capitol in my province of Isabela and that made us move a lot before I even started nursery. My late grandmother and grandfather used to always fetch me at the house when my parents go to work; it was a 30-minute car ride between us. My favorite memory with them is when they would bring me to Jollibee and eat at the car; we used to always listen to Ilocano songs because my grandpa had loads of mixtapes back then. My grandma was a teacher, she always used to teach me many heavy words and basic math, when I was three learned how to play chess, scrabble, and word factory as I would always play with them, and my grandpa taught me how to ride a bike at the same age. After my parents moved for the last time we lived with our grandparents. In pre-school, I always competed in extracurricular activities such as coloring, drawing, and pageants, I would always cry if I did not win or did not have a placing because I was such as competitive child. We would go on a lot on vacations especially in Ilocos and Quezon City, because we had houses there. We would go whenever it is the holidays or if a family member came home from the U.S. In elementary, I went to the school my grandma used to work at, I would get special treatment because they all were friends and respected her. My favorite memory when going on vacation is when we go to Ilocos, because we used to eat a lot of seafood in the beach during those visits. In addition, when we do visita iglesia in places we visit like in Manila. To sum it all up, I really enjoyed my childhood, especially when I was with my grandparents because they would spoil me a lot.

    My teenage years were full of surprises, as I tried different things that I never thought I could do or accomplished. As a first year in high school, I played for the varsity football team and I was the youngest with my teammates being juniors and seniors, we won interschool that year with no losses. During the pandemic is where I experienced puberty, before the pandemic, I was 5’3 and in a year, I grew to 5’9 that is when I started to lean more on basketball than football. I was not paying any attention to school during the pandemic because the online modality was just a new way of learning; I was not used to it. I also got addicted in gadgets and playing games during the pandemic, which caused me to lay around all day and be lazy. In senior high school, I transferred to a different school, in a new environment I thrived and those were my most active years yet. I was in varsity as a basketball player, a student leader in the classroom and in organizations, a performer in dancing and joining models, and an honor student. My senior high school years are the most memorable to me because I met many friends from different parts of my province and they made the experience more memorable. My teenage years were also the years where I experienced heartbreak after heartbreak because I was always unlucky when it comes to relationships. I was not proud of what I achieved during senior high, because I thought I under achieved in everything. I was not confident enough in basketball, causing me to make many poor decisions in playing and I always regretted the way my games played out. I did not win any pageants in those years also, always being a third placer and not being good enough to win. However, I really enjoyed my teenage years as it shaped me into who I am today. I am glad of the people I met during these years as they taught me to be more mature and responsible, shaping me to be a responsible adult and a decent human being.

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    My college experience so far has been a ride. I applied to different colleges in Luzon such as the University of Santo Tomas, University of the East, Mapua, Centro Escolar University, St. Paul University of the Philippines, and the University of St. Louis just to name a few. Choosing the right school for me was tough but I thought I made the right decision enrolling in UE Manila where I met people from different parts of the Philippines. I was new in Manila when I enrolled, still not familiar with the places here since I have been in Isabela for most of my life. Adapting to the city life was hard as everything here is fast paced; people in the province were more laid back. However, after a month, I got used to the lifestyle and I went to different places around Metro Manila to explore. At school I thought it would be like high school were I would be varsity and an honor student. However, basketball players here are taller, stronger, and more skilled than those I used to play with in the province. The class is also more competitive than in high school as it is tougher to become an honor student in college. In my first year, I ran for student council in my department. I lost but I really enjoyed the journey and the people I met. I met alumni and older students; I also became friends with many students from different departments in school. I really had fun in doing events where we helped people, especially in volunteering at helping pack and give food to the people who were hit with the typhoon. College is stressful compared to high school as I would also be the one to do my own chores in my dorm. I still have years of my college life left, and I am still chasing a dream that someday I would play college basketball. I am also thankful of the people I met during these years, as they have been a good support system for me mentally.
