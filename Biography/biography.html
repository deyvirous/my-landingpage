  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
   If I would describe my childhood, it would be fun and productive. My parents used to work at the capitol in my province of Isabela and that made us move a lot before I even started nursery. My late grandmother and grandfather used to always fetch me at the house when my parents go to work; it was a 30-minute car ride between us. My favorite memory with them is when they would bring me to Jollibee and eat at the car; we used to always listen to Ilocano songs because my grandpa had loads of mixtapes back then. My grandma was a teacher, she always used to teach me many heavy words and basic math, when I was three learned how to play chess, scrabble, and word factory as I would always play with them, and my grandpa taught me how to ride a bike at the same age. After my parents moved for the last time we lived with our grandparents. In pre-school, I always competed in extracurricular activities such as coloring, drawing, and pageants, I would always cry if I did not win or did not have a placing because I was such as competitive child. We would go on a lot on vacations especially in Ilocos and Quezon City, because we had houses there. We would go whenever it is the holidays or if a family member came home from the U.S. In elementary, I went to the school my grandma used to work at, I would get special treatment because they all were friends and respected her. My favorite memory when going on vacation is when we go to Ilocos, because we used to eat a lot of seafood in the beach during those visits. In addition, when we do visita iglesia in places we visit like in Manila. To sum it all up, I really enjoyed my childhood, especially when I was with my grandparents because they would spoil me a lot.

    My teenage years were full of surprises, as I tried different things that I never thought I could do or accomplished. As a first year in high school, I played for the varsity football team and I was the youngest with my teammates being juniors and seniors, we won interschool that year with no losses. During the pandemic is where I experienced puberty, before the pandemic, I was 5’3 and in a year, I grew to 5’9 that is when I started to lean more on basketball than football. I was not paying any attention to school during the pandemic because the online modality was just a new way of learning; I was not used to it. I also got addicted in gadgets and playing games during the pandemic, which caused me to lay around all day and be lazy. In senior high school, I transferred to a different school, in a new environment I thrived and those were my most active years yet. I was in varsity as a basketball player, a student leader in the classroom and in organizations, a performer in dancing and joining models, and an honor student. My senior high school years are the most memorable to me because I met many friends from different parts of my province and they made the experience more memorable. My teenage years were also the years where I experienced heartbreak after heartbreak because I was always unlucky when it comes to relationships. I was not proud of what I achieved during senior high, because I thought I under achieved in everything. I was not confident enough in basketball, causing me to make many poor decisions in playing and I always regretted the way my games played out. I did not win any pageants in those years also, always being a third placer and not being good enough to win. However, I really enjoyed my teenage years as it shaped me into who I am today. I am glad of the people I met during these years as they taught me to be more mature and responsible, shaping me to be a responsible adult and a decent human being.

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    To sum it all up, Artificial Intelligence makes a big difference because it is a great tool that makes tasks easier. We can all benefit from using Artificial Intelligence, but if you use it too much and for the wrong reasons, people can become dependent on it and it removes the purpose of learning and doing things on your own. As Artificial Intelligence continues to grow and become popular, people should be wary of the use of these tools in order for us to have purpose.
