    <h1>The Difference Maker</h1>
    <p>An essay on Artificial Intelligence and its impact</p>
  </header>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
   As the creation and rise of Artificial Intelligence continue, some may ask the question of how it changes the IT Industry, how it affects daily life, and the difference AI can make. In this modern era, Artificial Intelligence is taking over not just the IT or Tech Industry but also other industries, education, and most importantly our daily lives.

  <h2>Main Content</h2>
  <p>
    Before the creation of AI also known as Artificial Intelligence, life was more simple. Artificial Intelligence started to gain traction during the end of the Coronavirus epidemic. When I first discovered AI, I used it as a learning tool for topics I did not understand much, and classes I had missed due to being a student-athlete at the time. As a slow learner, AI helped me catch up with my peers. Then as time went by, I started getting lazy with my studies as I let Artificial Intelligence answer my homework for me rather than just guiding me because it made everything easier. It made a difference in my daily life as I finished academic tasks earlier, making my time more manageable as a student-athlete.

    The downside to this is I became too dependent on AI and became lazy with doing my studies without the help of Artificial Intelligence. This is also apparent for the rest of the world as people became more dependent on AI; professions changed forever. An example of this is the IT Industry. As AI became bigger, the industry became more in demand and changed. People were not hired simply because of talent in coding—they needed a certain level of knowledge about AI, because Artificial Intelligence can create code by simply instructing it to do so. This happens in various industries too such as the Art Industry. AI ruined the industry because of AI-generated media; people began to make videos, art, and music with just AI.

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    To sum it all up, Artificial Intelligence makes a big difference because it is a great tool that makes tasks easier. We can all benefit from using Artificial Intelligence, but if you use it too much and for the wrong reasons, people can become dependent on it and it removes the purpose of learning and doing things on your own. As Artificial Intelligence continues to grow and become popular, people should be wary of the use of these tools in order for us to have purpose.
